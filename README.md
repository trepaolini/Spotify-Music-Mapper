# Spotify Music Mapper


This web app uses python, javascript, and google app engine to create a simple map with all the places the artist from the music in your spotify account are.

To run the program, go to the folder file via bash/terminal and run this command:

dev_appserver.py .

From there, just log in to your spotify account! Don't worry if it isn't loading quickly, larger spotify accounts can take a lot of processing power to load.
